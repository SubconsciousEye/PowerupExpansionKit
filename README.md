# Powerup Expansion Kit
Makes possible to expand the maximum amount of powerup states.

# Misc info
- Powerup and GFX insertion determined by list files
- No bloat/powerups included other than the default powerups
- 32x32 player & customizable cape/5th tile
- No dynamic powerup items and projectiles (this sucked so much omg)
- List parsing powered by asar (no external programs needed = no need to support too many things at once)
- Easy to understand folder structure, everything customizable is contained in two folders
- Automatic handling of pointers, data insertion, freespace management and other stuff
- Literally better than the horrible mess that the Custom Powerup patch was

## Requirements
* Asar 1.81 (idk if I'm using features from it, might as well force people to update their Asar)
* DSS v2.00 (might not be very needed, but this is my project and I need it :D)
* PIXI v1.40 (whenever it comes out, also I don't even know if I use some of the new features lol)
