# Powerup Expansion Kit
Makes possible to expand the maximum amount of powerup states.

## Issues
- Check the issues page to know what's missing from the project

## Misc info
- Powerup and GFX insertion determined by list files
- No bloat/powerups included other than the default powerups
- No dynamic powerup items and projectiles (this sucked so much omg)
- List parsing powered by asar (no external programs needed = no need to support too many things at once)
- Easy to understand folder structure, everything customizable is contained in two folders
- Automatic handling of pointers, data insertion, freespace management and other stuff
- Literally better than the horrible mess that the Custom Powerup patch was

# Disclaimer
I have zero intentions of providing support to people who are 100% clueless about programming for the SNES, this project is made to fulfill my own purposes and I'd like to keep it that way. However, I will provide assistance to those who want to study the code I made for the project regardless of their intention. I also don't really care if you borrow code, hijacks, ideas or whatever from this repo, it's public after all. File organization and other things are subject to change.

## Requirements
* Asar 1.81 (idk if I'm using features from it, might as well force people to update their Asar)
* DSS v2.00 (might not be very needed, but this is my project and I need it :D)
* PIXI v1.40 (whenever it comes out, also I don't even know if I use some of the new features lol)
